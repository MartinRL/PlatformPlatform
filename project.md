# CritterPP: Event-Driven Platform Transformation

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: CritterPP (Critter Platform Platform)  
**Duration**: 6-8 months  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-24

## Vision Statement

Transform the existing PlatformPlatform .NET application from a traditional CRUD-based architecture to a cutting-edge event-driven system powered by the Critter Stack (Marten + Wolverine), enabling agentic code generation through specification-driven development.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Event-First Architecture**: Transition from state-based to event-based persistence using event sourcing
- **Agentic Development**: Enable AI-driven code generation from business specifications
- **Specification Driven**: Use Given-When-Then patterns for both command and view specifications
- **Technology Modernization**: Replace legacy components with modern alternatives:
  - SQL Server → PostgreSQL
  - MediatR → Wolverine
  - CRUD → Event Sourcing
  - EF Core → Marten

### Secondary Goals
- **Maintain Architecture**: Preserve vertical slice architecture and CQRS patterns
- **Improve Developer Experience**: Reduce boilerplate through code generation
- **Enhance Testability**: Leverage event sourcing for better testing capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilize Wolverine's superior performance over MediatR

## Technical Scope

### Core Transformations

#### 1. Data Architecture
- **From**: SQL Server with EF Core CRUD operations
- **To**: PostgreSQL with Marten event sourcing
- **Impact**: Complete data layer redesign

#### 2. Messaging Architecture
- **From**: MediatR for command/query handling
- **To**: Wolverine for low-ceremony messaging
- **Impact**: Simplified handler implementations

#### 3. Specification Framework
- **From**: Traditional domain models
- **To**: Event-based specifications with Given-When-Then patterns
- **Impact**: Enables agentic code generation

#### 4. Code Generation
- **From**: Manual implementation of business logic
- **To**: AI-generated code from specifications
- **Impact**: Accelerated development cycles

### Components in Scope

#### Application Services
- **Account Management**: User registration, authentication, tenant management
- **Back Office**: Administrative operations and support features
- **App Gateway**: API gateway and routing (minimal changes)
- **Shared Kernel**: Complete rewrite for event sourcing support

#### Infrastructure
- **Database**: Migration from SQL Server to PostgreSQL
- **Event Store**: Implementation using Marten
- **Projections**: Read models and view generation
- **Message Handling**: Wolverine-based command/query processing

### Components Out of Scope
- **Frontend Applications**: React SPAs remain unchanged
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Azure resources configuration unchanged
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions workflows unchanged
- **Developer CLI**: Minimal changes required

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Feature Parity**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all business events
3. **Agentic Generation**: AI can generate 80% of command handlers from specifications
4. **Performance**: Response times equal to or better than current system
5. **Scalability**: Support for millions of events and high-throughput scenarios

### Technical Requirements
1. **Zero Downtime**: Migration strategy with no service interruption
2. **Data Integrity**: Complete data migration with validation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: API contracts remain unchanged
4. **Testing Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive architectural documentation

### Quality Requirements
1. **Maintainability**: Code complexity reduction through specifications
2. **Testability**: Improved testing through event-based architecture
3. **Developer Experience**: Reduced time to implement new features
4. **Security**: Enhanced audit capabilities through event sourcing
5. **Observability**: Improved monitoring and debugging capabilities

## Key Stakeholders

### Technical Team
- **Lead Architect**: System design and technical decisions
- **Backend Developers**: Implementation of event sourcing and Critter Stack
- **DevOps Engineers**: Infrastructure and deployment automation
- **QA Engineers**: Testing strategy and validation

### Business Team
- **Product Owner**: Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Business Analysts**: Specification definition and validation
- **UX Designers**: Frontend integration and user experience

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Migration Complexity**: Converting existing relational data to event streams
- **Learning Curve**: Team adoption of event sourcing concepts
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Reliance on Marten and Wolverine ecosystem

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Unknowns**: Event sourcing performance characteristics
- **Integration Challenges**: Frontend and external system integration
- **Timeline Pressure**: Ambitious transformation timeline

### Low Risk
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Minimal cloud infrastructure modifications
- **API Compatibility**: Existing API contracts preserved
- **Development Tooling**: Familiar .NET development environment

## Next Steps

1. **Architecture Design**: Detailed technical architecture documentation
2. **Proof of Concept**: Small-scale implementation to validate approach
3. **Migration Strategy**: Phased migration plan with rollback procedures
4. **Team Training**: Critter Stack and event sourcing education
5. **Tooling Development**: Agentic code generation framework
